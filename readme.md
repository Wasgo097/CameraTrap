# About Project

## ToDo Client

```
[] Add configurable cuda processing into project (frame should be a wrapper on mat and gpumat, processors should be created by factory which create different type of processors)
[] Export module should contain both data export to the local drive and data sending to the server (communication submodule?)
[] App use a lot of cpu resources, reduce it without loosing performance 
[] Darkness compensation (another processor that only processes data when it's late?)
[] Builders and factories should contains settingsbuilder and path to settings instead of mainsettings ref
[X] VideoSource observer and observable 
[X] Multithreading (frame producer and consumer (Observer pattern?))
[X] Manager which connect all managers
[X] Refactoring AppClient constructor (connect with previous task?) 
```
